Our digital take on the classic "Whac-A-Mole" game that uses hand proximity detected by a series of ultrasonic distance sensors on an MCU to register hits on a VGA screen, with a De1-SoC FPGA board manading the increasing game difficulty and score updates.

## ~~Scuffed~~ Timeline
~~No way we pull this off~~
### Uncertainties
- How did they use 5V digital output to the 3.3V FPGA??????
### Nov 28
- Ultrasonic distance sensors fully controlled and communicating with FPGA (Samar)
- LED indicators for which "grid square" is being hit (Samar)
- Control mostly coded 
- Datapath mostly coded 
### Nov 29
- Audio coded
- VGA coded
- Look into SDRAM
- LFSR randomization algorithm 
### Nov 30 
All nighter in the lab
- Testing VGA 
- Testing Audio

Everything needs to be working at this point, final tweaks in the morning
